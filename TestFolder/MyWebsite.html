        <h1>Welcome to this website about Heidegger, and his famous book, Being and Time.</h1>

        <p>To start, here are some fun facts about Heidegger as a person</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Heidegger was a Nazi</li>
            <li>Heidegger calls the human being <b>Dasein</b></li>
            <li>He was German</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can find his text in the public domain <a href="http://pdf-objects.com/files/Heidegger-Martin-Being-and-Time-trans.-Macquarrie-Robinson-Blackwell-1962.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The text begins by discussing the idea that <i>being is time</i> and that we are not sperate from it, nor are we seperate from the objects in the world.</p>
        <p>He says that we should live as being-towards-death. He says that the most important part of our lives is our death and our finitude. </p>
